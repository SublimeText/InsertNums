Insert Nums has been rewritten completely!

It is highly recommended that you read the updated README.md (Preferenecs >
Insert Nums > README, or
(https://github.com/jbrooksuk/InsertNums/blob/master/README.md) for a full
explanation on functionality. **Make sure to read the examples.**


Here is a list of the most notable changes:

- An entirely new format syntax has been introduced that includes all previous
  features and an infinite amount of new ones.
  This essentially simplified the syntax for easy tasks and added options for
  complex tasks too.

- Python expression functionality has been added, modify numbers in any way
  you please (e.g. binary bitflags).

- An expression mode has been added which allows you modify the current value
  of a selection.

- The panel now previews your inputs live and removes them accordingly when
  you abort.
